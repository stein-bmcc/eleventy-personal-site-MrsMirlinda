    <h2>Product Test Case for Hypore</h2>
    <p>Summerize the information from <strong>Hypore</strong> above in your own words.</p>
    <p>What sort of presentation would you make to internal stakeholders with this information?</p>
    <p>Why did you choose us over a rival?</p>
    <p>
        I'd start out by taking a step back and looking at our corporate vision and key objectives for the year
        when presenting this data to stakeholders. Let's imagine, for instance, that our main goal is to grow the
        number of active users. I would remind the stakeholders of this. Then I'd explain how we distinguish out
        from rival companies because of our Support Team's excellent work in documenting, rapidly resolving problems,
        and guaranteeing a human response for every question.

        With 32% of our consumers citing our Support Team as the main reason they use our product, it becomes clear why our users chose us in the first place. Outside of Support, people rate our Pricing and Usability as fair, and at this time, improving our feature set and capabilities is our biggest opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an explanation:</p>
    <p>
        The 32% support team is performing admirably. <br>
        The cost is reasonable with 27%. <br>
        With the 25%, usability is good. <br>
        41f we want to grow by 17%, we need to add features. <br>
    </p>
    <p>Q2. Which of the following features do you like the most on the platform:</p>
    <p>
        Moving into our feature set today and what features our users enjoyed and found value in using, we have found that creating campaigns is our most liked
        feature at 38% across all users. <br>
        Are actions and value of creating campaigns on track with our larger business goals? <br>
        Are we happy with this result, or were we expecting a different feature to be on top? <br>
        Outside of this feature, we also noticed that &lt;25 % of our users like our other features such as the drag and drop builder, viewing real-time data, and data
        segmentation. This doesn't mean that these features aren't providing enough value, but I recommend we dig deeper by running user interviews or surveys
        with our users who rated these features lower on the scale to understand what can be improved. <br>
        Here's a breakdown: <br>
        1 Creating Campaigns 38% <br>
        2 Drag and Drop Builder 24% <br>
        3 Viewing Real-Time Data 20% <br>
        4 Data Segmentation 18% <br>
